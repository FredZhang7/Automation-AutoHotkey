# Image and Pixel Search #

#### Pixel Search
- Useful for identifying a color on your screen in RGB or HEX
- The `Diep.io Pixel Search.ahk` shows how slow and inaccurate pixel search can be

#### Image Search
- It's much more efficient and accurate than pixel search when comparing for UNIQUE traits in two images
- The library is not an AI algorithm like phash, so it doesn't work when you compare similar images (the unique traits must match).
- Only supports GIF, JPG, BMP (16-bit or higher), ICO, CUR, and ANI file extensions
