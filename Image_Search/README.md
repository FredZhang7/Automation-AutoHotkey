# Image and Pixel Search #

#### Pixel Search
- Useful for identifying a color on your screen in RGB or HEX

#### Image Search
- Is much more efficient and accurate than pixel search when comparing for UNIQUE traits in two images
- Contains a scaling image function
- The library is not an AI algorithm like phash, so does not work when you compare two mirrored images of each other.
