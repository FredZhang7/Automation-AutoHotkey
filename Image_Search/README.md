# Image and Pixel Search #

#### Pixel Search
- Useful for identifying a color on your screen in RGB or HEX
- Apologizes if the previous version didn't work

#### Image Search
- It's less accurate than pixel searches if you know exactly what the pixels colors are.
- The library is not an AI algorithm like phash, so it doesn't work when you compare similar images (the unique traits must match).
- Only supports GIF, JPG, BMP (16-bit or higher), ICO, CUR, and ANI file extensions
