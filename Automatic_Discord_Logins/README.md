# Infinite Accounts Discord Login #

After you do the following and ctrl+s, double left click on the script to run it.

1. Create a file on your PC that stores your Discord account login info in the order: (Line 1) your username (Line 2) your password. "(Line 1)" does not mean you actually type it out. . .
2. I already put a demo in my script on the file (that stores your usernames and passwords) path directory, but please visit https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/commands/FileReadLine.htm so you can rewrite Lines 33 and 38 with your own correct directories.
