# Automation Using C#

#### Description
- Simple keyboard, screen, and mouse manipulations using Auto Hotkey, written entirely in C#.
- Screen manipulations don't work too well on Discord.

#### IMPORTANT
- You must have Auto Hotkey installed. Right click in any path directory to create a new script.
- All script below requires you to press Windows + s to run the script, and Windows + d to delay/pause the script. Read the README.md in each separate file!!!
