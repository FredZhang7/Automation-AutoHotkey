# Automation Using C#

#### Description
- Simple keyboard, screen, and mouse manipulations using Auto Hotkey, written entirely in C#.

#### IMPORTANT
- You must have Auto Hotkey installed. Right click in any path directory to create a new script.
- All script below requires you to press Windows + s to run the script, and Windows + d to delay/pause the script. Read the README.md in each separate file!!!
- If you run into any problems, please email me at `freddyzhang666@gmail.com`. Thank you for visiting my repository =D Enjoy!

#### File Paths on Windows
- Comes in the form `Disk:\Folder One\Folder Two\fileName.fileExtension`
- For example, F:\Fred\Rick Roll.gif, C:\Program Files\My Secrets\Rick Roll.ahk
- Don't put any symbols found here in your file name: https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/Hotkeys.htm. Otherwise AHK recognizes it as a hotkey. However, when you send a message containing the symbol, you can write Send {!}, and this properly sends an exclamation mark.
